      <p>
        In Search of the Sacred Book studies the artistic incorporation of
        religious concepts such as prophecy, eternity, and the afterlife in the
        contemporary Latin American novel. It departs from sociopolitical
        readings by noting the continued relevance of religion in Latin American
        life and culture, despite modernity’s powerful secularizing influence.
        Analyzing Jorge Luis Borges’s secularized “narrative theology” in his
        essays and short stories, the book follows the development of the Latin
        American novel from the early twentieth century until today by examining
        the attempts of major novelists, from María Luisa Bombal, Alejo
        Carpentier, and Juan Rulfo, to Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez,
        and José Lezama Lima, to “sacralize” the novel by incorporating traits
        present in the sacred texts of many religions. It concludes with a view
        of the “desacralization” of the novel by more recent authors, from Elena
        Poniatowska and Fernando Vallejo to Roberto Bolaño.

        <span>Critical edition by Aníbal González-Pérez</span>
        <br />
        <br /> Manuel Zeno Gandía nació en Arecibo en 1855, hijo de hacendados
        dedicados al cultivo de la caña de azúcar. Comenzó su carrera literaria
        y de gestión cultural mientras cursaba estudios de medicina en Madrid.
        Tuvo la oportunidad de coincidir, en sus estadías en España y en
        Francia, con los momentos de mayor debate público sobre el Realismo y el
        Naturalismo, las dos escuelas narrativas más importantes del siglo XIX
        en Europa. En Puerto Rico, tuvo una vida activa como periodista —fue
        propietario de La Correspondencia— y como político, habiendo militado en
        grupos o partidos independentistas. Como escritor literario, cultivó con
        éxito la novela, el cuento, la poesía y el ensayo crítico. Su novela La
        charca (1894) ha tenido un éxito sostenido, siendo considerada la novela
        cumbre del Naturalismo en Puerto Rico. Esta es la primera edición
        crítica de Redentores (1925), su última novela.

    title: 'Love and Politics in the Contemporary Spanish American Novel',
    image: '/love-and-politics.jpg',
    description: (
      <p>
        The Latin American Literary Boom was marked by complex novels steeped in
        magical realism and questions of nationalism, often with themes of
        surreal violence. In recent years, however, those revolutionary projects
        of the sixties and seventies have given way to quite a different
        narrative vision and ideology. Dubbed the new sentimentalism, this trend
        is now keenly elucidated in Love and Politics in the Contemporary
        Spanish American Novel. Offering a rich account of the rise of this new
        mode, as well as its political and cultural implications, Aníbal
        González delivers a close reading of novels by Miguel Barnet, Elena
        Poniatowska, Isabel Allende, Alfredo Bryce Echenique, Gabriel García
        Márquez, Antonio Skármeta, Luis Rafael Sánchez, and others. González
        proposes that new sentimental novels are inspired principally by a
        desire to heal the division, rancor, and fear produced by decades of
        social and political upheaval. Valuing pop culture above the
        avant-garde, such works also tend to celebrate agape—the love of one’s
        neighbor—while denouncing the negative effects of passion (eros).
        Illuminating these and other aspects of post-Boom prose, Love and
        Politics in the Contemporary Spanish American Novel takes a fresh look
        at contemporary works.

    title: 'A Companion to Spanish American Modernismo',
    image: '/companion-modernismo.jpg',
    description: (
      <p>
        Modernismo, a literary movement of fundamental importance to Spanish
        America and Spain, occurred at the turn of the nineteenth century,
        roughly from the 1880s to the 1920s. It is widely regarded as the first
        Spanish-language literary movement that originated in the New World and
        that became influential in the “Mother Country,” Spain. Characterized by
        the appropriation of French Symbolist aesthetics into Spanish-language
        literature, modernismo’s other significant traits were its cultural
        cosmopolitanism, its philological concern with language, literary
        history, and literary technique, and its journalistic penchant for
        novelty and fashion. Despite the splendor of modernista poetry,
        modernismo is now understood as a broad movement whose impact was felt
        just as strongly in the prose genres: the short story, the novel, the
        essay, and the journalistic crónica [chronicle]. Conceived as an
        introduction to modernismo as well as an account of the current state of
        the art of modernismo studies, this book examines the movement’s
        contribution to the various Spanish American literary genres, its main
        authors [from Martí and Nájera to Darío and Rodó], its social and
        historical context, and its continuing relevance to the work of
        contemporary Spanish American authors such as Gabriel García Márquez,
        Sergio Ramírez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.

      'Killer Books: Writing, Violence, and Ethics in Modern Spanish American Narrative',
    image: '/killer-books.jpg',
    description: (
      <p>
        Writing and violence have been inextricably linked in Spanish America
        from the Conquest onward. Spanish authorities used written edicts, laws,
        permits, regulations, logbooks, and account books to control indigenous
        peoples whose cultures were predominantly oral, giving rise to a mingled
        awe and mistrust of the power of the written word that persists in
        Spanish American culture to the present day. In this masterful study,
        Aníbal González traces and describes how Spanish American writers have
        reflected ethically in their works about writing’s relation to violence
        and about their own relation to writing. Using an approach that owes
        much to the recent “turn to ethics” in deconstruction and to the works
        of Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas, he examines selected short
        stories and novels by major Spanish American authors from the late
        nineteenth through the twentieth centuries: Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera,
        Manuel Zeno Gandía, Teresa de la Parra, Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo
        Carpentier, Gabriel García Márquez, and Julio Cortázar. He shows how
        these authors frequently display an attitude he calls “graphophobia,” an
        intense awareness of the potential dangers of the written word.
